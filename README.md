## Overview

An android software that aggregates notifications from other apps for you. It is like a notification bar in your phone, but not a notification bar. It simply helps me to focus on using those app to communicate and give up other functionalities, while I can decide to have an uninterrupted period of my own.

## A Story

One day I woke up from the bed and unlocked my phone, consciouslessly, I tapped on different apps to check notifications: wechat, qq, outlook, whatsapp, etc. And I saw a friend posted a video on wechat, clicked on it, and slided the screen to watch more videos. When I got back myself, I realised it has been 1 hour and told myself should go to work. However, when I started working on my research project, I found that it is not easy to focus.

It could be a normal day like usual. But suddenly, a question comes to me: what can I do to minimize the effect of distraction from those apps while being able to communicate with the world. There have been so many moments in my life that I just consciouslessly tapped on those apps to check notifications and oftenly, there is no notifications at all but I get attracted into other contents. If I want to avoid to be attracted into them, the best way is not to see them. I realised the reasons: it is too easy to access those unrelevant contents when you just want to check your notifications or communicate with someone.

> As the book "Deep Work" says, "In the era of internet, our society culture drives us into a frequently interrupted environment. This expose a hugh opportunity to knowledge workers who knows how to work deeply".

Indeed, I do want sometime to check my messages and communicate with others. And I also want to have an uninterrupted time to work on my own. But I don't want to use other functionalities that is unnecessary. 

Thus, I started to develop this app. An app that helps me to set an uninterrupted period during which I can't access any notifications and to collect all notifications for me so that I don't need to tapped on every app to do so. More importantly, it builds a wall distances from unnecessary and distracted functionalities that could unintentionally steal my time and attention.

## Features
1. Collect wechat notification and display by person.
2. Collect all other notifications and display by apps.
3. Set up an uniterupted time period, during which notification is collected on the background but cann't be accessed.
